options for random -> random speed/ direction from hitting the rectangle
random block colours
random sound when hitting the block
random power when hitting the up or down button

blocks get hit and fall down and are removed from the game -> but while in play the ball bounces off the brick only once. as it 
is falling it is out of play, so it will just fall through anything else.
